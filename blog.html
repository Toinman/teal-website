        <h2>Add the chemistry of a startup to your corporate environment</h2>
        <p>It is really challenging to innovate inside an existing and successful company. Since a couple of years,
        corporates are adding corporate accelerators to their innovation programs.</p>
        <p>Such partnerships between corporates and startups combine the best of both worlds. They improve time to
            market, create extra flexibility, boost operating speed, increase brand awareness and act as a neutral
            party in co-sourcing or co-funding tracks.</p>
        <p>This is where Teal Partners comes in. We are a small and flexible community of multi-disciplinary craftsmen,
            specifically founded to generate and realise innovative, ambitious ideas within the ecosystem of a
            corporate environment.</p>
